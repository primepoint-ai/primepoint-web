        Privacy Policy or as otherwise explained at the time of collection.</p>
    <p><strong>Automatic collection.</strong> As you navigate the Service, our communications, and other online
        services, we and our service providers automatically collect information about you, your computer or device, and
        your browsing actions and use patterns. For example, this includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device data</strong>. Technical information about your computer or mobile device&rsquo;s operating
            system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU
            usage,
            device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique device identification numbers or other identifiers,
            language
            settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location
            information such as city, state, or geographic area.

            diagnostics
            and
            crash logs).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Web technologies.</strong> The following technologies enable some of the automatic collection
        described above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies. </strong>Cookies are text files that websites store on a visitor&rsquo;s device to
            uniquely identify the visitor&rsquo;s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the
            purpose
            of tracking user activity and patterns, helping the visitor navigate between pages efficiently, remembering
            preferences, improving the visitor&rsquo;s browsing experience, and enabling analytics. Cookies used on our
            site
            include cookies that we serve as well as cookies served by third parties that we work with to enable the
            services
            they provide, such as analytics services that track traffic and usage. You can learn more about cookies and
            how
            to
            control them at <a href=" http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. You can learn more
            about
            Google Analytics, one of the analytics services we use, and how to opt-out of being tracked by Google
            Analytics,
            here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></li>
        <li><strong>Pixels</strong>. Also known as web beacons or clear GIFs, pixels are embedded in software code
            or invisibly in image files within webpages or HTML formatted emails and used to demonstrate that a webpage
            or
            email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics
            about
            usage of websites and the performance of marketing campaigns. We may use pixels to collect information about
            your
            interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a
            message,
            the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Browser web storage.</strong> Also referred to as locally stored objects or HTML5, browser web
            storage functions like cookies but enables the storage of a larger amount of data.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Session replay.</strong>We use
            third party services that employ software code in the Service to record users&rsquo; interactions with the
            Services in a manner that allows us to watch and analyze visual reconstructions of those user sessions. The
            replays include users&rsquo; clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes during those sessions. These
            replays
            help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Third party sources</strong>. We combine personal information we receive from you or collect
        automatically when you use the Service with personal information we obtain from other sources, such as:</p>

            party service, such as Microsoft, that service may provide us with your name, email address, photo, and
            other
            data
            according to your settings in that service.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Our contacts. </strong>Our business contacts who share details about their professional contacts,
            including potential customers and partners.

            information in your settings.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Contact your administrator. </strong>Our application is intended for use by organizations. Where
            our application is made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), that organization is
            the administrator of the application and is responsible for the application user accounts that it controls.
            If
            this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions and requests to your administrator, as your use
            of
            the
            application is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security
            practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than ours. Administrators may be
            able to restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the application; access information about your
            application
            account and activity in it; and restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify, or delete information

        <li><strong>Delete application data.</strong> If you use our application and wish to request deletion of
            your Primepoint account and the personal information we handle in connection with the application, you can

            or
            be unable to process your request without the administrator&rsquo;s approval.

            browser web storage, prevent pixels/clear gifs from loading, and block javascript software code. To do this,
