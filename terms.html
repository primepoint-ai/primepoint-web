            <p>This <b>Master Subscription Agreement </b>(this "<b>MSA</b>") is entered into as of the effective date listed above
                (the "<b>Effective Date</b>") by and between Primepoint Labs Inc. ("<b>Primepoint</b>") and the entity listed above
                ("<b>Customer</b>"). For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
                acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p>
              <ol>

              </ol>
              <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Order Forms.</b> Customer and Primepoint may, from time to time, enter into order forms outlining (i)
                  Primepoint's hosted services to be provided to Customer (the "<b>Services</b>"), (ii) any implementation services
                  to be provided to Customer (the "<b>Implementation Services</b>"),<b> </b>(iii) the initial subscription term
                  applicable to the Services (the "<b>Initial Subscription Term</b>"), (iv) the fees for access to the Services
                  and/or provision of the Implementation Services (the "<b>Fees</b>"), and (v) any other terms deemed relevant by
                  the parties. When mutually executed, each such order form is an "<b>Order Form</b>" as defined herein. The first
                  Order Form is set forth on <b>Exhibit A </b>and, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, each subsequent
                  Order Form will be in the same form and format as that set forth on <b>Exhibit A</b>.</li>
                <li><b>This MSA. </b>This MSA is incorporated by this reference into all Order Forms. This MSA and all Order Forms
                  are collectively referred to as this "<b>Agreement</b>."<b> </b>Capitalized terms utilized but not defined in this
                  MSA are defined in the Order Form and vice versa. To the extent that a conflict arises between the terms and
                  conditions of an Order Form and the terms and conditions of this MSA, the terms and conditions of this MSA will
                  govern unless the Order Form specifically states otherwise. </li>

              <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Access.</b> Subject to Customer's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon
                  the parties' mutual execution of an Order Form, during the Term (as defined below), Primepoint will (i) provide
                  Customer with access to the Services described on such Order Form and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
                  provide any Implementation Services described on such Order Form. </li>
                <li><b>Customer Obligations. </b>Customer will (i) timely grant Primepoint access to all Customer systems,

                  services as necessary for Customer to access the Services, and (iii) perform all other responsibilities ascribed

                  Services; (ix) disclose to any third party any performance information or analysis relating to the Services; (x)

                  infringement claim regarding the Services. Customer is solely responsible for (A) the acts and omissions of its
                  Users and any such acts and any act or omission of any User will, for purposes of this Agreement, be deemed an act
                  or omission of Customer and (B) all activities that occur on Customer's or any User's account for access to the
                  Services. </li>

              <ol start="3">
                <li><b>Fees. </b>Customer will pay all Fees to Primepoint as set forth herein. Customer will pay all invoiced Fees
                  (a) in accordance with the invoicing and payment terms set forth in the applicable Order Form or (b) if none are
                  specified in such Order Form, within 15 days after the date of the applicable invoice. Customer will pay all Fees
                  in U.S. dollars and without setoff, counterclaim, deduction, recoupment, or withholding of any kind for amounts
                  owed or purportedly owed by Primepoint under this Agreement, applicable law, or otherwise. Customer is responsible
                  for all taxes on all Fees, excluding any taxes on Primepoint's net income. All Fees are non-refundable and
                  non-cancelable. Any amounts not paid when due will bear interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate allowable
                  by law, whichever is less. Primepoint may modify any Fees, in whole or in part, on written notice to Customer.

              <ol type="a">
                <li><b>By Primepoint. </b>Primepoint will defend Customer against any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding
                  (a "<b>Claim</b>") alleging that the Services, as provided to Customer, infringe any intellectual property rights
                  of any third party and will pay all resulting damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction or agreed in a settlement approved by Primepoint in accordance with this Section 7. Primepoint's
                  obligations in this Section 7(a) will not apply to the extent the Claim results from or arises in connection with
                  (i) any combination of the Services (or any portion thereof) with any equipment, software, data, or any other
                  materials or technology not provided by Primepoint, (ii) any modification to the Services by any party other than
                  Primepoint or its authorized personnel, (iii) the use of the Services in a manner contrary to the terms of this
                  Agreement, and/or (iv) the continued use of the Services after Primepoint has provided substantially equivalent
                  non-infringing software or services.</li>
                <li><b>By Customer.</b> Customer will defend Primepoint and its directors, officers, employees and agents from any
                  Claims, and will indemnify and hold harmless the foregoing from and against all related damages, liabilities,
                  costs and expenses, resulting from or arising in connection with (i) the Customer Data, (ii) any negligence or
                  willful misconduct by Customer or a party acting on its behalf, and/or (iii) any alleged or actual breach of
                  Customer's representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement.</li>
                <li><b>Infringement Claims. </b>In the event of a Claim pursuant to Section 7(a), or if Primepoint believes that
                  such Claim may be brought, Primepoint may, at its option and expense, (i) replace the Services with a
                  non-infringing equivalent, (ii) modify the Services so they are non-infringing, (iii) procure for Customer the
                  right to continue using the Services, or (iv) terminate this Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Customer.
                  SECTION 7(a) AND THIS SECTION 7(c) SET FORTH CUSTOMER'S SOLE REMEDY AND PRIMEPOINT'S SOLE OBLIGATION FOR THE
                  CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 7(a).</li>
                <li><b>Procedures.</b> The indemnifying party's indemnification obligations under this Section 7 are conditioned
                  upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice of the Claim to the indemnifying party once the
                  indemnified party becomes aware of the Claim (provided that failure to provide prompt written notice to the
                  indemnifying party will not alleviate an indemnifying party's obligations under this Section 7 to the extent any
                  associated delay does not materially prejudice or impair the defense of the related Claims), (ii) granting the
                  indemnifying party the option to take sole control of the defense (including granting the indemnifying party the
                  right to select and use counsel of its own choosing) and settlement of the Claim (except that the indemnified
                  party's prior written approval will be required for any settlement that reasonably can be expected to require an
                  affirmative obligation of the indemnified party), and (iii) providing reasonable cooperation to the indemnifying
                  party, and at the indemnifying party's request and expense, assistance in the defense or settlement of the Claim.

                <li><b>Other Miscellaneous.</b> This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by both
                  parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court to be void or otherwise unenforceable, the
                  remainder of this Agreement will remain valid and enforceable as though such void or unenforceable provision were
                  absent on the date of its execution. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors, and
